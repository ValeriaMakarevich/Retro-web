# 🌐 Retro-web

**Retro-web** is a web application that immerses you in the atmosphere of the old internet.  
Here, you can learn interesting facts about different eras, explore the design of web pages from the past, and see popular memes and GIFs of the time.  

Each era is represented as a separate page with its unique style, colors, and visual elements. You can travel along the timeline — from the 1960s to the 2000s — and see how web design and technologies evolved over the decades.  

The application is built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, using dynamic CSS module imports. It demonstrates how to recreate the nostalgic atmosphere of old interfaces while leveraging modern web technologies.  

⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently under development.
